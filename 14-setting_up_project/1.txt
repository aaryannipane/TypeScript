# first initialize the TS in the folder using cmd
$tsc --init 
# create JSON file for typescript configuration 

# set up npm using cmd
$npm init -y

# create two folders name ["src", "dist"]
# in src we will create "index.ts" file
# in dist (distribution) folder TS will auto create JS file when compiled
# creat index.html in root folder
# link js file in html file

# to tell TS to compile TS file to JS in folder "dist"
# go to TS config file and unComment "outDir" and give path to "dist" folder

# when often chanfes made in TS file we don't want to run tsc again and again 
# we can use watch mode of typescript that will detect changes and auto compile TS file
$tsc -W 

# install lite-server npm package
$npm i lite-server

# run lite-server
$lite-server

# then also TS watch 
$tsc -W 

# now we can compile TS file to JS and this changes is captured by server and reloads the page on browser
