there are two ways to install typescript 
globaly (for learning)
inside project (in react projects or any)

for globaly installation

check version of typescript by cmd
$tsc -v

To write typescript create file with extension .ts 
then write some code 

then convert or transpiled it to javascript code by using cmd 
$tsc filename.ts
